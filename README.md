## Version 0.0.1su.1
Added ***Parallax*** and a way to make ***Custom Buttons***<br>
Also changed ***globals.py*** to ***engine_constants.py*** 
which led to requirement of ***window_size.py*** outside the engine
<br>
<br>
*window_size.py:*
```
width = [window widht specified by user]
height = [window height specified by user]
```
<br>
This version is semi-updatable, which means that to update engine's version in your project
